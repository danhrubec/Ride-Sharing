# NYC Ride-Sharing (Fall 2020)
This project was created for CS 480 - Database Systems. The goal was to calculate total mileage saved if taxi riders in NYC were to share rides over riding solo. 
Collaborating with a group of 4, we worked with SQL and Python - Jupyter Notebook to determine the mileage saved.
One team member and I focused on downloading the dataset from the NYC government website, https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.
We imported the dataset into SQL and cleaned the set out, removing unnecessary information and unusable data (canceled rides), as well as adding columns for our other team to use like estimated speed.
We then exported the dataset to our other team which focused on using the dataset and writing a bruteforce algorithm to determine which rides were best paired for mileage saved.
Afterwards, for each month of data, we were able to determine a total mileage saved for that month, which we can convert to a potential dollar amount saved.
